# my_early_projects

Hi! I am a kid who started doing programming in python at an early age. I am really into the programming world and aspiring to learn more about new languages and upcoming technologies . This repository is going to include my early python projects . 

#What is in my repo 

My repo will include some projects on the application of turtle graphics, some interesting projects made by using python 

#What I'm learning !

I am currently working on sharpening my python skills , and learning more about python and applying that knowledge to build fun and interesting projects , also I am looking forward to continue working upon my this new hobby ..

#Difficulties

It takes a lot of time making the projects , and the most timetaking part for building my projects always had been to dubug my code ..there were also times when I can't find the error or can't get the main idea for the execution of my code .. So I had to use the AI sometimes to rectify the error,and seeing it somewhere also boosts my skills on debugging .
 Moreover, I always feel more thrilled and excited when I learn more about python and to make projects than games..
